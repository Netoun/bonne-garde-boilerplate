/**
 * The API's provider seam, `dockerfile` variant: Elysia on Bun in one container that also serves
 * the built SPA, so the API and the front share one origin. It replaces the `cloudflare` variant
 * of this package and exports the same four names, which `apps/api` and the modules import and
 * nothing else:
 * - `runtimeOptions`: the constructor options of `new Elysia(...)` that differ per provider.
 * - `readRuntimeEnv()`: the environment record, read once by `apps/api`'s config.
 * - `clientIpHeaders`: the request headers that carry the client's address, in the order to read them.
 * - `serve(app)`: what `apps/api/src/index.ts` default-exports. Bun serves a default-exported
 *   `{ port, fetch }` by itself when that file is the entry, so nothing here calls `listen()`:
 *   doing both would start two servers on one port.
