# storage/r2

Media uploads over an R2 bucket, for the project's API: image upload, a public file route, a record per
upload with its author and organization, and delete with an ownership check. It is the legacy
`apps/api/src/lib/r2.ts` and `apps/api/src/modules/media` extracted into their own package,
`packages/storage`, which `apps/api` mounts.

```bash
bunx bg add provider/cloudflare config/branding api/elysia db/d1 orm/drizzle auth/better-auth storage/r2
```

## Peers and variant

| Peer       | Allow-list    | Why                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `provider` | `cloudflare`  | `readRuntimeEnv` from `{{SCOPE}}/api-runtime` reads the `BUCKET` binding; R2 is Cloudflare's     |
| `db`       | `d1`          | `bindD1()` from `{{SCOPE}}/db/d1`: the media record lives in the project's D1                    |
| `orm`      | `drizzle`     | `createDB` from `{{SCOPE}}/db` and the test database from `{{SCOPE}}/db/testing`                 |
| `auth`     | `better-auth` | the `auth` macro guards the routes, and `medias` has foreign keys onto `user` and `organization` |

One variant, `cloudflare`, selected on the provider (035: `storage` MUST declare `peers.provider`). A
project on the `dockerfile` provider has no R2 bucket and no `db`, so it cannot install this module:
`bg add storage/r2` there is refused with `storage/r2 accepts only cloudflare for provider, but
provider/dockerfile is present`.

**It names no `api` peer.** No source of the package reaches the shell's `lib/*`, and a project that can
install `auth` already has an `api`. The patches below target `apps/api`; without one they would fail
into pending intentions, but `auth` makes that case unreachable.

## What it writes

Everything in `packages/storage`, from explicit paths:

| File                    | What it is                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `package.json`          | `{{SCOPE}}/storage`: the `.` and `./schema` exports, the `typecheck` and `test` scripts               |
| `src/r2.ts`             | `R2Error`, `validateFile`, `validateKey`, `generateKey`, `publicUrlFor`, `uploadToR2`, `deleteFromR2` |
| `src/bucket.ts`         | `bindR2(env)` and `readR2()`: the `BUCKET` binding, or `undefined` (see below)                        |
| `src/env.ts`            | `resolveStorageEnv`: `R2_PUBLIC_URL`, read from `readRuntimeEnv()`                                    |
| `src/schema.ts`         | the `medias` table and its relations                                                                  |
| `src/media.contract.ts` | the Elysia body and params of the routes                                                              |
| `src/media.service.ts`  | `createMediaService(context)` and the plugin that puts `mediaService` on a route's context            |
| `src/media.routes.ts`   | the routes, guarded by an `auth` macro they are given                                                 |
| `src/media.module.ts`   | `mediaModule`, which `apps/api` mounts, and `resolveRuntimeStorage()`, what a request runs against    |
| `src/index.ts`          | what `apps/api` imports                                                                               |
| `src/testing.ts`        | `startTestBucket()` and `createTestStorage()`, for this package's tests                               |
| `src/*.test.ts`         | 63 tests: the legacy ones that travel, and the new ones                                               |

Dependencies are exact: `drizzle-orm` and `elysia` at the releases `auth` and `orm/drizzle` pin (a
contract test compares them), the project's `api-runtime`, `auth` and `db` as workspaces, and, for the
tests, `miniflare`, `@cloudflare/workers-types` (the same releases `db/d1` pins) and `@elysiajs/eden`.

## Where it is served

Under `/v1/media`, as the legacy API did, and the `/v1` is the module's: `mediaModule` is an
`Elysia({ prefix: "/v1" })` over routes with a `/media` prefix. The API shell has no `/v1` group, and the
module does not wait for one, because the path is stored: `medias.url` is `<R2_PUBLIC_URL>/<key>`, and
`R2_PUBLIC_URL` defaults to `<API_URL>/v1/media/file` (the `dockerfile` runtime derives the same path).
Moving the routes would break every url already written to a database. A front calls them through
Eden as `api.v1.media`.

| Route                  | Auth    | Does                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET /v1/media/file/*` | none    | serves an object by key, cached for a year; `400 INVALID_KEY` for an unsafe key            |
| `POST /v1/media`       | session | uploads an image (jpeg, png, webp, gif, 10 MB at most) and records it                      |
| `DELETE /v1/media/:id` | session | deletes the object and the record, for its author or an admin or owner of its organization |
| `GET /v1/media/:id`    | session | the record, with its author and organization                                               |

The routes are given the `auth` macro: `mediaModule` is built with `authMacro` from `{{SCOPE}}/auth`, and
`mediaPlugin(resolveStorage, macro)` takes another, which is how the tests run the real routes behind a real
Better Auth session.

## The bucket binding

`bindR2(env)` returns the `BUCKET` binding, **or `undefined`**, and does not stand in a bucket that fails
on first use the way `db/d1` does for D1. The legacy service branches on a missing bucket, and 080 says to
keep behaviour: an upload and a file request answer `500 BUCKET_NOT_CONFIGURED`, and a delete still removes
the record of a media. A string var named `BUCKET` is not taken for the binding: it has to have `put`,
`get`, `delete`, `head` and `list`.

`BUCKET` is one of the two bindings AGENTS.md allows to be Cloudflare-specific; the module's one `jsonc.merge`
declares it, in the default environment and in `production`:

```jsonc
"r2_buckets": [{ "binding": "BUCKET", "bucket_name": "my-app-media" }],
"vars": { "R2_PUBLIC_URL": "http://localhost:5172/v1/media/file" },
// and the same under env.production, with https://api.my-app.com/v1/media/file
```

`my-app-media` and `api.my-app.com` are the placeholders the other modules use for the project's names
(`bg add` renders `{{SCOPE}}` and nothing else): replace them by hand. The bucket itself is created with
`bunx wrangler r2 bucket create <name>`; `wrangler dev` runs against a local one.

## Environment

The module declares `R2_PUBLIC_URL` (`required`, example the local media route) and reads it through
`readRuntimeEnv()`, never through the shell's `app.config.ts`. A key belongs to the module that reads it
(035), so neither provider nor `api/elysia` declares it, and the shell boots, and answers `/health`, without
this module. The value is read **per request**, not at import: a missing one fails the request that needs it,
naming the key (`Missing required environment variables: R2_PUBLIC_URL`). Under `NODE_ENV=test` it gets the
local media route.

The `dockerfile` runtime still derives `R2_PUBLIC_URL` from `APP_URL` inside its own `readRuntimeEnv`. That
is container behaviour, as its generation of `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` is, and nothing reads the value there: that
provider has no bucket.

## The `medias` table

`schema.ts` is the legacy `medias` table and `mediasRelations`, byte for byte but for the import of the auth
tables from `{{SCOPE}}/auth/schema`. `coreSchema`, the legacy aggregate, is not shipped: the barrel gathers the
tables. The file imports nothing of the project but that, and runs nothing when it loads, because
`packages/db`'s schema barrel re-exports it and an import back into the project would be a module cycle.

`organization_id` cascades on delete; **`author_id` does not**. With media rows, `DELETE FROM "user"` fails on
that foreign key, so `auth`'s `bun run db:reset` fails once a project has uploaded anything. Golden seeds no
media, so it does not see this. Clearing `medias` first (`wrangler d1 execute DB --local --command 'DELETE FROM medias'`
from `apps/api`) is what to do until a seam exists for a module to add a step to another's reset.

## Wiring (060)

The module writes nothing outside `packages/storage` by copy. It reaches the rest of the project through six
patches on four known seams, each with the sentence a failure turns into a pending intention:

| Type                   | File                              | Regions                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `jsonc.merge`          | `apps/api/wrangler.jsonc`         | `r2_buckets`, `vars.R2_PUBLIC_URL`, `env.production.r2_buckets`, `env.production.vars.R2_PUBLIC_URL` |
| `package.dependencies` | `apps/api/package.json`           | `dependencies.{{SCOPE}}/storage`                                                                     |
| `ts.addImport`         | `apps/api/src/app.ts`             | `imports[{{SCOPE}}/storage]`                                                                         |
| `ts.elysiaUse`         | `apps/api/src/app.ts`             | `elysia[app].use[mediaModule]`                                                                       |
| `package.dependencies` | `packages/db/package.json`        | `dependencies.{{SCOPE}}/storage`                                                                     |
| `ts.addNamedExport`    | `packages/db/src/schema/index.ts` | `exports[{{SCOPE}}/storage/schema]`                                                                  |

`.use(mediaModule)` lands after `.use(authModule)`. The export is `medias` and `mediasRelations` (a contract test
compares it with `schema.ts`), so `bun run db:generate` in `packages/db` writes `medias` into the project's one
migration, and `createDB` sees it. The wiring adds a `db` and `storage` workspace cycle (the barrel re-exports
storage's table, storage reads `createDB`), like the one `auth` has; Bun, `tsc` and `bun test` resolve it.

## Tests

63 tests in the project, against what is real: an R2 bucket from Miniflare (workerd's own, not a stand-in), an
in-memory SQLite that has the auth and media tables, and a Better Auth instance for the sessions. Nothing is
mocked. The legacy ones travel: `r2.test.ts`, the file route of `media.routes.test.ts`, and the service cases
of `media.e2e.test.ts`, which now go through the real routes at `/v1/media` where the legacy file re-implemented
the handlers in the test. New: `bucket.test.ts` (the binding, and a variable that is not one), `env.test.ts`,
`media.module.test.ts` (what `apps/api` mounts, with no Worker: `BUCKET_NOT_CONFIGURED`, `401`), `exports.test.ts`
(the subpaths the project imports), and in `media.e2e.test.ts` the `401` of each guarded route, an admin deleting
a member's media, and `404` of `GET /v1/media/:id`.

They import `{{SCOPE}}/…` packages that exist only in a project, so `test:scripts` skips this directory and
golden is where they run, with a floor on the count.

## Not here

- **`lib/env.ts`'s `BUCKET` and `R2_PUBLIC_URL`, and `app.config.ts`'s requirement of the second.** The shell
  never had them; this module reads its own.
- **`mediaFileParams`, `mediaResponse`, `errorResponse`** and their types in the legacy contract: nothing used them.
- **A `dockerfile` variant.** The container has no bucket; a storage module for it (a volume, S3) is a new module
  with its own `peers.provider`.
- **`checkMediaReferences`** still returns an empty list, as in the legacy service: it is the seam where a
  resource that holds a media would block its deletion (`409 MEDIA_IN_USE`), and nothing holds one yet.
